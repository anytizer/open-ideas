# open-ideas
Project ideas open to everyone.

![Logo](logo.png)

* Are you a prototype-ist?
* Are you a software developer?
* Are you looking for some project ideas?
* Are you a student?

Just pick up one of the ideas from my list and start developing yourself.
Optionally, please let me know the idea that you have picked, so that in the future, I can manage what is happening to my open ideas. And even link them back to your project.

Thank you for your understanding.

If you have anything to suggest, improve on these ideas, please do.

## Disclaimer
The linking of the projects are not of commercial values.
