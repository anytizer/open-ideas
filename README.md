Project ideas open to everyone

* Are you a student?
* Are you a software developer?
* Are you looking for some project ideas?
* Are you a prototypist?

Just pick up one of the ideas from my list and start developing yourself.
Optionally, please let me know that you have picked an idea, so that in the future, I can manage what is happening to the ideas, and even link them to your projects.

Thank you for your understanding.
