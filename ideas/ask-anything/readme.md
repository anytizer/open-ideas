## Considerations:

Experts are not looking for questions voluntarily, nor they have enough time to scan though the questions.
Hence, an admin/classifier in the middle manages the questions and answering process.

Avoid too generic questions.
Only approved questions will be answered.
Answers are subject to build the community knowledge.
