Ask anything

Raise a question by a registered member of the community.
Classify the question.
Assign an expert to reply.

Considerations:

Experts are not looking for questions voluntarily, nor they have enough time to scan though the questions.
Hence, an admin/classifier in the middle manages the questions and answering.

Avoid generic questions.
Anyone subscribed to the category can review the discussions.
